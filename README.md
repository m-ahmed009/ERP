# ERP System

A role-based ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system built with Laravel. The system includes three user roles: Admin, Manager, and Salesperson â€” each with their own dedicated dashboards. Key features include customer, vendor, and product management, sales processing, invoice generation, and comprehensive stock reporting. Admin and Manager can add products, vendors, and customers, while Salesperson handles sales and invoice generation. Admin also has full visibility into system reports and activities. This is a full-fledged ERP tailored for small to medium-sized businesses.
